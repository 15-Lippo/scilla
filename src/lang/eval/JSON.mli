(** The state input is a json containing an array state variables.
 ** Each state variable is a list of the following key value pairs:
 **    "vname" : "variable name"
 **    "type" : "valid scilla type"
 **    "value" : "value of the variable as a string"
 ** Map variables are encoded with the "type" being set to "Map"
 ** and the actual keyType/valType and key/val being encoded as:
        "vname" : "backers",
        "type" : "Map", Â 
        "value" :
 Â       [
         {
           "keyType" : "Address",
           "valType" : "Int"
         },
         {
           "key" : "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
           "val" : "100"
        },
       ]
    i.e., the "value" for Maps is an array of key/val pairs, with
    the first such pair being an exception, used to store the
    types of the key/val, specified as "keyType" and "valType".
